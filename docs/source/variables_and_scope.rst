Variables
=========

*See*\ `Syntax Overview: Variables <./syntax_overview.md#variables>`__

Variables may only contain lower case letters and underscores. They are
assigned using the colon (:) operator. The value is left on the stack
after the assignment has occurred.

::

   aya> 1 :a
   1
   aya> 3:b a +
   4

Variable Scope
--------------

A new scope is introduced if a block contains any variable declaration
in its header. When a variable assignment occurs, the interpreter will
walk outward until a reference to that variable appears. If it does not
appear in any of the scopes before the global scope, a new reference
will be created there. In order to ensure a variable is using local
scope, the variable name must be included in the block header. If a
block does not contain a header, a new scope will not be introduced.
These concepts are best demonstrated by example.

Let us introduce the variables a and b:

::

   "A":a; "B":b;

When blocks have arguments, a scope is introduced for that variable.
Here, the number zero is assigned to ``b`` within the scope of the
block. When the block ends, the scope is destroyed and we reference the
now global variable ``b``.

::

   aya> 0 {b, b.P}~ b.P
   0B

Local variables also create local scopes for that variable. Here, we
create a local scope for the variable ``b``. ``a`` is not included in
the new scope.

::

   aya> .# Local variable b declared in header
     {:b,
       0:a;
       1:b;
       "a = $a," .P
       "b = $b\n" .P
     }~ 
     "a = $a," .P
     "a = $b\n" .P

   a = 0,b = 1
   a = 0,a = B

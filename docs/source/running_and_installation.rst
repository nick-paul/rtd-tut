Running / Installation
======================

Aya is written in java. Please ensure you have the latest version of
java on your system.

Download the latest release from the `releases
page <https://github.com/aya-lang/aya/releases>`__.

Once downloaded, simply double click ``aya.jar`` to run the aya GUI.

If your system does not support double clicking a jar to run it, you may
optionally run it using the following command:

::

   java -jar aya.jar

**NOTE**: ``aya.jar`` must be in the same directory as the rest of the
files included in the download.

Running Examples
----------------

There are many example scripts in the ``examples/`` directory. To run an
example, type its name followed by the ``example`` command:

::

   aya> "nth_fib" example
   The first 10 fib numbers are [ 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 ]

Some examples are in subfolders such as ``canvas``, ``turtle``, or
``plot``. Run them using ``subfolder/example_name``:

::

   aya> "canvas/mandelbrot" example

.. figure:: img/mandelbrot_example.png
   :alt: img/mandelbrot_example.png

   img/mandelbrot_example.png

Command Line Arguments
----------------------

All arguments are optional.

-  The first argument is the directory to point aya at when running.
-  If the second argument is ``-i``, run the aya repl directly in the
   terminal.
-  All the following arguments are scripts to run

::

   $ ls my_scripts/aya_scripts/
   hello.aya
   $ rlwrap java -jar ~/git/aya/aya.jar my_scripts/aya_scripts/ -i
   aya> "hello.aya" G~
   Hello world!

System Install
--------------

This step is only needed if you would like to add aya to your systems
path. *Currently only supports OSX/Linux*

Aya supports running scripts directly from the command line. For
example:

::

   $ cat hello.aya 
   #!/usr/bin/env aya
   "Hello world!" :P

   $ chmod +x hello.aya

   $ ./hello.aya 
   Hello world!

To enable this, add ``aya/runnable/linux`` to your path:

For example, you can add this line to your bashrc:

::

   PATH="$PATH:/<path_to_aya>/aya/runnable/linux"

Numbers
=======

Aya has several representations for numbers: Num (represented by a
double), BigNum, Rationals, and Complex (coming soon). Numbers are only
promoted when needed. Number literals are always converted to Nums. Aya
uses standard mathematical operators.

::

   3 4 +   .# => 7
   5 6 -   .# => -1
   2 0.5 * .# => 1.0
   3 2 ^   .# => 9
   6 4 /   .# => 1.5
   6 2 /   .# => 3

``-`` is never a unary operator.

::

   8 3 -1  .# is evaluated as (8 3-) 1 => 5 1
   -1      .# ERROR: Empty stack at operator '-'

To write negative numbers, use a colon (with or without a -)

::

   :1.5   .# => -1.5
   :-1.5  .# => -1.5

Special Number Literals
-----------------------

*See*\ `Syntax Overview:
Numbers <https://github.com/aya-lang/aya/wiki/Syntax-Overview#numbers>`__

Special number literals always begin with a colon. Special number
literals can be used to create negative numbers, **bignums**,
**rationals**, and **complex numbers** *(coming soon)*.

::

   .# A colon paired with a number with no additional formatting is negative
   :3    .# -3
   :-3   .# -3

   .# BigNums end with a z
   :123z      .# 123
   :-3.1232z  .# -3.1232

   .# Rational numbers separated numerator and denominator with a r
   :1r2   .# 1/2
   :3r    .# 3/1

   .# Complex numbers are separated with an i
   :1i    .# The imaginary unit
   :2i5   .# 2i + 5

Special number literals also provide ways for creating numbers using
binary and hexadecimal formatting.

::

   .# Hexadecimals begin with :0x
   .# All letters must be lowercase
   :0xff  .# 255
   :0x111 .# 273

   .# Binary literals begin with :0b
   :0b11010  .# 26

   .# Large hexidecimal and binary numbers are converted to BigNums
   :0xfffffff    .# 268435455 (Num)
   :0xffffffff   .# 4294967295 (BigNum)

Misc. Number Literals
---------------------

Like all number literals, these values are evaluated pre-runtime.

Scientific Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number literals of the form ``:NeM`` are evaluated to the literal number
``N * 10^M``.

::

   aya> :4e3
   4000 
   aya> :2.45e12
   2450000000000 
   aya> :1.1e-3
   .0011 

PI Times
~~~~~~~~

Number literals of the form ``:NpM`` are evaluated to the literal number
``(N * PI)^M``. If no ``M`` is provided, use the value 1.

::

   aya> :1p2
   9.8696044 
   aya> :1p
   3.14159265 
   aya> :3p2
   88.82643961 

Root Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number literals of the form ``:NqM`` are evaluated to the literal number
``N^(1/M)``. The default value of M is 2.

::

   aya> :2q
   1.41421356 
   aya> :9q
   3 
   aya> :27q3
   3
